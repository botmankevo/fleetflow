Here’s what we can actually determine and what you need for a deep AI-agent prompt to clone the functionality of ezloads.net (as a transportation management system + load board + logistics SaaS), without copying the visual design or proprietary code.

🔍 What ezLoads is (functionality overview)

ezLoads.net is a transportation management system (TMS) for trucking/logistics with features including:

Load board & load management

Dispatch board

Driver app & driver status updates

Document uploads (BOLs, PODs)

Invoicing/payment processing

Accounting & reporting

Integrations (QuickBooks, ELD/telematics)

AI-assisted rate confirmation parsing

Fleet & driver compliance tracking

Customer portals for tracking history and status

External load booking integrations (e.g., Uber Freight)

It’s not just a simple load listing — it’s a full cloud TMS SaaS product.

⚙️ Likely Architecture

We can’t definitively tell the technology stack just from the public site (no obvious indicators in source HTML). Tools like BuiltWith/Wappalyzer are usually needed for that kind of detection. But based on the product profile:

Frontend

Likely a JavaScript SPA (modern interactive app)

Uses standard HTML/CSS/JS with heavy dynamic interaction (filters, boards)

Could be built with frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular (unconfirmed without inspection tools)

Backend

Full SaaS backend handling auth, business logic, APIs

Likely built with common web stacks (possible Node, Python, .NET, Ruby, PHP — not publicly confirmed)

Data & Integrations

Database storing users, loads, dispatches, docs

Integrations with telematics, QuickBooks, load sources

Because public tech detection isn’t available without a tool, we’ll focus on how to rebuild the backend API abstraction your clone will need.

🧠 What You Should Extract From ezLoads’ Features

This will inform the AI agent coding prompt:

Authentication & Roles

Admin, dispatcher, driver, shipper roles

Secure authentication (JWT / session tokens)

Core Entities

Loads

Users (dispatchers/carriers/shippers)

Documents (BOL, POD, rate confirmations)

Vehicles (fleet records)

Invoices

Tracking status

Load Board / Search

Full text & filters (origin, destination, weight, rate, date)

Pagination API

Booking interactions

Dispatch & Driver Updates

Assign loads

Status updates

Driver document upload

Analytics & Reporting

Profit & loss

IFTA

Accounting exports

Integrations

QuickBooks (OAuth + API sync)

ELD telematics (GPS updates)

Load sources like Uber Freight (API integration)

All of that is generic SaaS logistics workflows — not design.

🧠 AI-Agent Prompt (Starter)

Here’s a ready-to-paste prompt you can feed into your AI agents (OpenAI, GPT-4o, Claude, etc.) to generate code and documentation for this project.

✨ AI Prompt: Build the Logistics SaaS Backend
You are an expert software architect and full-stack developer. I want a clean, modular backend API for a transportation management system (TMS) with a load board, dispatch board, driver & shipper portals, document uploads, and integrations.

The backend should use Node.js + Express (or another modern framework like NestJS, Django, or ASP.NET Core), PostgreSQL as the database, and produce a RESTful JSON API.

Define:

1. **Database schema** for:
   - Users (roles: admin, dispatcher, driver, shipper)
   - Loads (origin, destination, weight, rate, status, dates)
   - Documents (file metadata, type, load association)
   - Vehicles/fleet
   - Invoices
   - Activity logs

2. **API endpoints** with method, path, request body, response format, and necessary business logic:
   - Auth: register, login (JWT), role middleware
   - Loadboard: list loads, filter by criteria, pagination
   - Load assignment for dispatch
   - Upload document endpoints
   - Driver status updates
   - Reporting endpoints (profit/loss, IFTA)

3. **Models and relationships** with constraints (foreign keys, indexes)

4. **Sample API responses** for success/failure formats

5. **Authentication & Authorization** rules (role-based access control)

6. **Integrations**:
   - QuickBooks sync outline (OAuth flow, invoice sync)
   - ELD telematics API (webhook or polling model)
   - Optional 3rd-party load source API schematic

7. **Tests** structure (unit & integration) with example test cases

Output code in modular files (models, routes, services) with clean architecture, comments, and a README.

Don’t write UI code — this is backend only.

🧠 AI Prompt: Frontend API Integration
You are a senior full-stack developer. Create a frontend application (framework: Next.js or React) that connects to the API defined earlier.

Define:

1. Pages/screens:
   - Login / register
   - Loadboard (search & filter)
   - Dispatch board
   - Driver dashboard with status updates
   - Document upload views
   - Reporting dashboard

2. API service module to communicate with the REST API:
   - axios or fetch wrappers
   - auth token handling

3. State management (context or Redux)

4. Example UI components (without styling), just functional JSX.

5. Error handling design and auth redirects.

Output scaffolded code with comments and example calls to the backend.

🧠 AI Prompt: Documentation & Deployment
Generate project documentation:

1. ER diagram for the database
2. API docs in OpenAPI/Swagger format
3. Deployment guide (Docker, Kubernetes, environment variables)
4. CI/CD pipeline file (GitHub Actions or GitLab CI)
5. Security checklist

📌 Summary

ezLoads is a full SaaS TMS + load board, not just a simple load listing tool.

We’re not copying code/design — we’re recreating the structure & workflows.

Use the prompts above with your AI agents to generate a robust backend + API + docs.
