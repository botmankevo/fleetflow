You are acting as a senior full-stack engineer reviewing this codebase.

Your task is to verify frontend ↔ backend API consistency.

Instructions:

Scan the frontend code and identify every API call (REST, GraphQL, fetch, axios, SDKs, hooks, services).

For each call, extract:

HTTP method

Endpoint path

Request payload shape

Expected response shape

Scan the backend and confirm that for every frontend call:

A corresponding endpoint exists

The HTTP method matches

The route is mounted and reachable

Auth, validation, and middleware are correctly applied

If an endpoint is missing, incomplete, or mismatched, explicitly mark it as UNIMPLEMENTED.

Produce an Endpoint Mapping Table with:

Frontend file / location

Method

Path

Backend file / handler

Status (Implemented / Missing / Partial)

Do not assume endpoints exist unless you can clearly identify them in backend code or API documentation.

Conclude with:

A list of missing or mismatched endpoints

OR a confirmation that frontend and backend are fully aligned
