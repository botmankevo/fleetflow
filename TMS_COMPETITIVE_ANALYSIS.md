## 💡 The Bottom Line

**You have 60-70% of a competitive TMS!**

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Solid foundation
- ✅ Modern tech
- ✅ Better UX than competitors
- ✅ Unique AI features

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Dispatch board (critical!)
- ❌ Customer management
- ❌ Invoicing/AR/AP
- ❌ Communication system
- ❌ Load board integration

**The Good News:**
Your missing features are mostly UI/workflow, not complex algorithms. You have the hard stuff done (payroll, settlements, mapping, OCR).

**The Reality:**
Most carriers would pay for what you have NOW, but to compete with McLeod/TMW/Rose Rocket, you need the dispatch board, customer management, and invoicing.

**Priority: Build the Dispatch Board first. It's what users see all day, every day.**
